# Password Generator

## Description:
This application enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of password special characters](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters) from the OWASP Foundation. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
